- 👋 Hi, I'm @Aletheia_
- 👀 I'm interested in learning how to program, learn about personal finance and how to manage it well, I'm also interested in learning about photography, video and video editing both....
- 🌱 I'm currently learning to program, I do a little of this and I started to resume learning English, I've been doing it for a while and I think I already see some results.
- 💞️ I'm looking to collaborate in some project about programming, taking into account that I still don't have great knowledge because I want to take experience and learning about it.
